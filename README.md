NLP Intent-Based Conversational Chatbot

This project implements a closed-domain conversational chatbot using classic NLP techniques.
It uses text normalization, TF-IDF vectorization, and Logistic Regression to classify user intents and generate appropriate responses.

The system demonstrates how traditional NLP pipelines handle conversational flow, input noise, and intent ambiguity.
